= What is Image Compression? =

Learn more about image compression, check that: <a href="https://imagify.io/images-compression">https://imagify.io/images-compression</a>

= Why use Imagify to optimize you images? =

You already have a lots of unoptimized images? Not a problem, you will love the Bulk Optimizer to optimize all your existing images in one click.

Imagify can directly resize your images, **you won't have to lose time anymore on resizing your images before uploading them**.

Three level of compression are available:

- Normal, a lossless compression algorithm. The image quality won't be altered at all.
- Agressive, a lossy compression algorithm. Stronger compression with a tiny loss of quality most of the time this is not even noticeable at all.
- Ultra, our strongest compression method using a lossy algorithm.

With the backup option, you can change your mind whenever you want by restoring your images to their original version or optimize them to another compression level.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Which formats can be optimized? =

Imagify can optimize jpg, png and gif (whether animated or not) formats.

= Can I use the plugin with a free account? =

Absolutely. You are limited to a quota of 25 MB of images per month with a free account. Once this quota is reached, you cannot optimize new images until your quota is renewed or you purchase credits.

= On how many websites can I use the plugin? =

You can use the plugin on as many sites as you wish. The only limit is the optimization quota of your account.

= I used Kraken, Shortpixel, Optimus, EWWW or WP Smush, will Imagify further optimize my images? =

Absolutely. Most of the time, Imagify will still be able to optimize your images even if you have already compressed them with another tool.

= What is the difference between the Normal, Aggressive and Ultra compression levels? =

Normal compression is a "lossless" optimization. This means there is no loss of image quality. Aggressive and Ultra compression are more powerful, so the picture quality will be somewhat reduced. The weight of the image will be much less.

= Is the EXIF data of images removes? =

By default EXIF data is removed. It is however possible to keep it by enabling the option.

= Will the original images be deleted? =

No. Imagify automatically replaces the images with an optimized image. The backup option allows you to keep the original images and restore them with one click.

= Is it possible to re-optimize images with a different level? =

Yes. By activating the backup option in the plugin, you can re-optimize each image with a different compression level.

= If I use Imagify, do I need to continue optimizing and resizing my images with Photoshop? =

Do not waste your time resizing and optimizing your images in Photoshop. Imagify takes care of everything!

= What happens when the plugin is disabled? =

When the plugin is disabled, your existing images remain optimized. Backups of the original images are still available if you have enabled the images backup option.
